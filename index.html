						<h1>Find a WordPress Meetup</h1>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>Meetup groups are locally-organized groups that get together for face-to-face events on a regular basis (commonly once a month). Anything that brings together 2 or more people to share their WordPress experiences counts — there’s no minimum number of attendees or required format.</p>
						<p>These events (commonly referred to as meetups, which can be confusing since people often use the same word to describe the group itself) take many formats: presentations/lecture series, hackathons, social gatherings, workshops, coworking, running a WordPress help desk, contributor sprints/drives, and others.</p>
						<p>If you'd like to get involved with speaking or organising, please contact the organisers of the meetup.</p>
						<p>If you'd like to start a new WordPress meetup in your city, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/">start here</a>. WP Australia can also help with mentoring and resources, so please let us know on Slack.</p>

					<p><strong>1. Purpose</strong></p>

					<p>WP Australia believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor.</p>

					<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behaviour as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.</p>

					<p>We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive community experience for everyone.</p>

					<p><strong>2. Open Source Citizenship</strong></p>

					<p>A supplemental goal of this code of conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise and strengthen the relationships between what we do and the community at large.</p>

					<p>In service of this goal, the WP Australia organisers will be taking nominations for exemplary citizens.</p>

					<p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know. You can nominate someone by talking to the event organiser or online.</p>

					<p><strong>3. Expected Behaviour</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
						<li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour and speech.</li>
						<li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.</li>
						<li>Alert community organisers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.</li>
						<li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create WP Australia and make it your own.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>4. Unacceptable Behaviour</strong></p>

					<p>Unacceptable behaviours include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any members of  WP Australia and related events. All WP Australia venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>

					<p>Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

					<p><strong>5. Consequences Of Unacceptable Behaviour</strong></p>

					<p>Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, organisers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of the WP Australia venues.</p>

					<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.</p>

					<p>If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community without warning or refund.</p>

					<p><strong>6. What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behaviour</strong></p>

					<p>If you are subjected to unacceptable behaviour, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organiser as soon as possible or fill out an incident report if the incident was online.</p>

					<p>The WP Australia team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behaviour to feel safe in the community.</p>

					<p><strong>7. Scope</strong></p>

					<p>We expect all community members, sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests to abide by this code of conduct at all venues and related social events.</p>

					<p><strong>8. Contact Information</strong></p>

					<p>The WP Australia leadership team can be contacted via Slack.</p>
